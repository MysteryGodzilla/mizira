# Custom plugins

Your own tools go here. Everything in this folder except this README is
git-ignored, so site-specific tools never end up in the repo. In Docker, put
them in the `plugins/` folder of the mounted config folder; the image links
`custom-plugins/` to it, so `config.yml` names them the same way in both.

A plugin is any executable that answers two calls:

- `./tool.py --schema` prints a JSON tool definition: `title`, `description`,
  `properties`, `required`, plus the optional `sandbox` policy and `requires`,
  the environment variables it cannot work without. An enabled tool with a
  missing `requires` entry stops the bot at startup.
- `./tool.py --execute '<json args>'` runs it and prints the result.

Two optional extras:

- A result whose first line starts with `action: ` is posted to the channel as a
  `/me`; the rest of the result goes to the model as usual.
- `"announce": false` in the schema keeps the "calling <tool>" line out of the
  channel, for tools whose output is itself the visible effect.

List it in `config.yml` under `tool:` as `custom-plugins/tool.py`, in Docker
too. Make it executable.

The shared `metald_tools` package is on `PYTHONPATH` for every tool, so a
custom plugin gets the same building blocks as the shipped ones:

```python
from metald_tools import toollog, safetyreview, urlguard
from metald_tools.hosting import upload_file, HostingError  # configured backend + UPLOAD_HEADERS
from metald_tools.media import strip_audio_metadata, strip_mp4_metadata
from metald_tools.promptrefine import refine_prompt
```

Put its settings and secrets under `env:` in `config.yml`, never in the plugin; the bot passes them to every tool as environment variables.
