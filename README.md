# Metald

**Metald** is an IRC chatbot driven by an LLM. It is a fork of [pkdindustries/soulshack](https://github.com/pkdindustries/soulshack), licensed under GPL-3 like the original.

## Features

-   **Any model**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Ollama, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
-   **Tools**: shell and Python plugins, MCP servers, and native IRC tools. Shipped plugins cover web search and page fetch (Exa), code execution in a throwaway Fly.io microVM (Python, bash, and C/C++ compiled and run so the bot can check its own code), image, music, video and speech generation (ComfyUI), speech-to-text, image understanding, Wikipedia, MusicBrainz, YouTube transcripts and pastes; Context7 library docs come over MCP.
-   **Several networks at once**, each with its own nick, channels and conversations. Up to `maxconcurrent` requests (default 3) run at a time across all of them; each request's question and answer are written to history together when it finishes.
-   **Per-network isolation**: memories, ignores, flood counters, reminders and suspicion scores never cross between networks.
-   **Screening**: named nicks (`screennicks`, `filternicks`, `+screen`), or with `screenall` everyone but admins, are put behind a classifier on the way in and have replies checked on the way out, with a deterministic block on any reply that reproduces the system prompt. Both checks fail closed: if the classifier can't give a clear verdict, the message is refused.
-   **Injection resistance**: fake `<think>`/tool tags are stripped from input, reasoning the model writes into its reply is filtered, each turn has an output budget, refused tool arguments are removed from history, and a decaying per-speaker suspicion score drops only that speaker's turns.
-   **Persistent memory** (SQLite) with a classifier on every write, so nobody can store an instruction disguised as a fact. Facts about the speaker, and about anyone or anything the message mentions, reach the model without it having to ask.
-   **Conversations that last**: history is saved and survives restarts. Older turns are folded into a running per-channel recap instead of being dropped, recent channel chatter the bot was not addressed in is passed along with the next request, and past chat is searchable with `history__search`. Screened and ignored nicks are kept out of all of it.
-   **Runtime control** through `+` commands, persisted across restarts.

## Quickstart

### From source

Requires Go 1.26+ and Python 3 for the plugins.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/B4reMetal/metald.git
cd metald
go build -o metald ./cmd/metald
cp examples/chatbot.yml config.yml     # then edit server, channel, model, tools
./metald --config config.yml
```

### Docker

Images for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` are built from `main` and rebuilt weekly for base-image security fixes:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/b4remetal/metald:latest
```

They contain the binary, Python 3, curl, jq, ffmpeg, a current yt-dlp and every shipped plugin. The image itself is never written to: everything the container reads or writes lives in one folder mounted at `/config`, and the container can run with `--read-only`.

| path | contents |
|---|---|
| `config.yml` | every setting, including tool secrets under `env:` |
| `plugins/` | your own plugins, listed in `config.yml` as `custom-plugins/<name>`, the same name they have outside Docker |
| `data/` | runtime state: the SQLite memory and conversation databases, reminders, ignores, settings changed at runtime, the tools' error log (`tool-errors.log`), and temp and cache files |

```bash
mkdir config
docker run --rm --read-only -v $(pwd)/config:/config ghcr.io/b4remetal/metald:latest
# first start: writes config/config.yml from the example and stops; edit it, then
docker run -d --name metald --read-only -v $(pwd)/config:/config ghcr.io/b4remetal/metald:latest
```

`examples/docker-compose.yml` does the same. The container runs as an unprivileged user, so the mounted folder must be writable by it; on Linux, `chown` the folder to the uid the error message names, or add `--user $(id -u)`. To build the image yourself: `docker build . -t metald`.

## Configuration

Everything is set in one file, `config.yml`. Start from `examples/chatbot.yml`, which documents every key and carries the default text of every prompt.

-   **Bot settings** are flat top-level keys named after the command-line flags: `nick`, `server`, `channel`, `model`, `tool`, `admins`, and so on. Each one can also be given as `--<name>` or as the environment variable `METALD_<NAME>`; a flag beats the environment, which beats `config.yml`. `./metald --help` lists them all.
-   **Tool settings** go under `env:`: API keys, service URLs and tool prompts, named as each plugin documents them. The bot passes every entry to every tool it runs as an environment variable. A variable already set in the real environment (for example `docker run -e EXA_API_KEY=...`) takes precedence.
-   **Every prompt is configurable, and none is built in.** Twenty-one are required by the bot itself: `floorprompt`, `gatekeeperpreamble`, `gatekeeperpolicy`, `classifypreamble`, `replyscreenpolicy`, `memorypolicy`, `memoryframe`, `relevantframe`, `recapprompt`, `recapframe`, `backlogframe`, `toolretrynote`, `emptyreplynote`, `taskprompt`, `goalprompt`, `goalroundprompt`, `goalverifyprompt`, `delegateprompt`, `claimnudge`, `quotedpolicy` and `roommemoryframe`. The plugins' prompts and safety policies are required settings under `env:`. The bot refuses to start and names anything missing; `examples/chatbot.yml` carries the default text of all of them.
-   **Changes made at runtime** with `+set`, `+admins`, `+tools restrict` or `+screen` are saved to `config-overrides.json` in the data directory and survive restarts. `config.yml` itself is never rewritten.

A minimal file, with the required prompts omitted for brevity:

```yaml
nick: metald
server: irc.example.com
port: 6697
tls: true
channel: "#chat"
admins:
  - "yournick!*@your.host"

model: openai/gpt-5.1
openaikey: "sk-..."

tool:
  - plugins/datetime.sh
  - plugins/websearch.py
  - irc__op

env:
  EXA_API_KEY: "..."
```

### Models

Set `model` to `provider/name`:

| provider | example | also set |
|---|---|---|
| OpenAI | `openai/gpt-5.1` | `openaikey` |
| OpenAI-compatible (LiteLLM, vLLM, llama.cpp…) | `openai/<model>` | `openaiurl`, and `openaikey` if the endpoint needs one |
| Anthropic | `anthropic/claude-opus-4.5` | `anthropickey` |
| Google | `gemini/<model>` | `geminikey` |
| Ollama | `ollama/qwen3:30b` | `ollamaurl` (default `http://localhost:11434`) |

`thinkingeffort` is `off` by default. `low`, `medium` and `high` are standard; any other value is passed to the backend, which decides whether it exists.

### Common settings

| key | default | |
|---|---|---|
| `nick` | `metald` | bot nickname |
| `server`, `port` | `localhost`, `6667` | IRC server |
| `tls`, `tlsinsecure` | off | TLS, and skipping certificate checks |
| `channel`, `channelkey` | | channel to join, and its key. The bot speaks only here: events from any other channel are ignored |
| `botnicks`, `botprefixes` | | other bots: by nick (bots with their own account), or by line prefix such as `[metalai]` (bots sharing their owner's nick). A prefixed line is the bot, not its owner: never admin, "me" means the bot (`metalai`), and memories, logs and the Safety page record it as `owner [metalai]` |
| `botreplylimit`, `botcooldown` | `5`, `10m` | how many replies to bots in a row before waiting for a human, and the quiet time that resets it |
| `partunlisted` | off | leave other channels the bot is joined to (e.g. by a server auto-join), once per connection |
| `saslnick`, `saslpass`, `serverpass` | | authentication. A password needs `tls: true` and `tlsinsecure: false`, or the bot refuses to start |
| `networks` | | several networks; each entry takes `name`, `nick`, `server`, `port`, `channel`, `channelkey`, `tls`, `tlsinsecure`, `saslnick`, `saslpass`, `serverpass` and `responseprefix`, and inherits anything it leaves out |
| `admins` | none | hostmasks allowed to run admin commands, as `nick!ident@host` with `*` and `?` wildcards (case-insensitive; `/whois` yourself to see yours). Masks that would match nearly anyone (`*!*@*`) are refused. Empty means nobody |
| `addressed`, `trigger` | on, the nick | answer only when addressed, and the word that addresses the bot |
| `commandprefix` | `+` | what starts a command |
| `responseprefix` | | text put in front of every reply line |
| `model`, `maxtokens`, `temperature` | `ollama/llama3.2`, `16384`, `0.7` | model settings |
| `top_p`, `top_k`, `min_p`, `presence_penalty`, `repeat_penalty`, `dry_multiplier`, `dry_base`, `dry_allowed_length`, `dry_penalty_last_n` | unset | optional sampling; unset ones are not sent, so the server's default applies. `+set <key> default` clears one |
| `apitimeout` | `5m` | limit for one request, tool calls included |
| `maxconcurrent` | `3` | requests handled at once across all networks |
| `sessionduration` | `10m` | after this long idle, a conversation's older turns are folded into its recap (the last 6 turns stay word for word) |
| `maxcontext` | `0` (unlimited) | history kept word for word, in tokens; past it, the oldest part is folded into the recap |
| `channelbacklog`, `channelbacklogwindow` | `30`, `20m` | unaddressed channel lines passed along with the next request, and how far back they reach (`0` turns it off) |
| `recapmax` | `6000` | character limit of a channel recap |
| `historydays` | `30` | days of chat kept for `history__search` (`0` keeps no chat log) |
| `maxiterations` | `10` | model calls one request may make, tool rounds included |
| `taskmaxtime`, `taskmaxiterations`, `taskmaxtokens` | `30m`, `30`, `65536` | budget of one background task; `taskmaxtokens` is the output one model call in it may produce, thinking included |
| `taskdailylimit`, `taskmaxactive` | `3`, `1` | per-nick task limits for non-admins (`taskdailylimit: 0` makes tasks admin-only) |
| `goalmaxruns`, `goalmaxtime`, `goaldeadline` | `20`, `60m`, `24h` | budget of one goal |
| `goalupdateinterval` | `5m` | least time between a goal's progress lines |
| `screennicks`, `filternicks` | | nicks screened on the way in and on the way out |
| `screenall` | `false` | screen every non-admin in and out, as if all were listed above; live with `+set screenall true` |
| `floodmessages`, `floodwindow`, `floodtimeout` | `5`, `30s`, `5m` | automatic timeout for floods |
| `tool`, `admintools` | | tools to load, and tools only admins may trigger |
| `datadir` | `.` | where runtime state is kept |
| `urlwatcher` | off | comment on links posted in the channel |
| `sandbox` | off | run shell, bash and MCP tools in a platform sandbox |
| `verbose`, `loglevel`, `logformat` | off, `info`, `text` | console logging |
| `commandsneedname` | on | commands only work as `<name> +command`, so one `+help` doesn't trigger every bot in the channel |
| `maxreplylines` | `4` | most IRC lines one reply may post; the rest is dropped (`0` = no limit). The persona can ask for short replies, but this guarantees it |
| `logfile`, `logmaxsize`, `logkeep` | `logs/mizira.log`, `10`, `5` | logs are also written as JSON lines to this file (relative to `datadir`; `off` disables), rotated at `logmaxsize` MB, keeping `logkeep` old files |

## Operator page

Set `adminlisten` (e.g. `127.0.0.1:8766`) and `admintoken` and the bot serves a private operator page:
uptime and what it is working on right now (each request, waiting or running, and for how long); the GPU
queue job by job (what made it, its prompt, how long it has waited or run) with **Stop/Remove**, which the
tool reports as a cancellation rather than a failure to retry; the radio; every task, goal and schedule per
network with **Cancel** (stops a running round, like `+task cancel`) and **Pause/Resume work**; pending
reminders with **Cancel**; and live **Logs** and the model's **Thinking** as it streams, held in memory only
(reasoning is never saved to conversation history). It stays off
unless both settings are set; every API call needs `Authorization: Bearer <admintoken>`, and every change
is logged (`admin_request`). Keep it on localhost or a private network: an address on every interface (`0.0.0.0`, `::`, `:port`) is refused, and 10 wrong tokens from one client in 10 minutes lock it out for 5. Mizira's console adds a **Mizira** card (Pause / Stop / Resume, the same as `~pause`, `~stop`, `~resume`, logged as `console_action`), a **Conversation** tab (history size, persona, recap, recent lines with the time each entered history, Reset and Clear recap as `~reset` and `~recap clear` do), a **People** tab (ignores, screened nicks and suspicion scores, changed with the commands' own code), a **Memories** tab (browse by subject, room memory apart, search, add, edit, forget; older repeats are marked; notes she proposed when chat was folded into the recap, about herself (self-notes) and about the people who spoke (people-notes), to approve, edit or deny, also with `~selfnotes`; approved people-notes become memories about that person; and **Compact**, which asks the model to merge one subject's memories into a shorter list you review and edit before it replaces them), a **Safety** tab (what she refused, screened out or quarantined, from the log file, by kind and per person), **Bots**, **Settings** (every `~set` key except credentials, with config.yml's value and Reset) and **Tools** (switch the bot's own tools, background work and plugins on or off; kept across restarts) and **Commands** (every IRC command grouped by topic, what it does and whether it's admin-only, from the bot's own command list) tabs, and a banner listing whatever differs from config.yml, with **Export to a file** (writes config.yml with those changes folded in beside it, never over it; comments kept, nothing secret shown on the page) and **Reset all**, and hides the cards of features that are off (Background work, Reminders, GPU, Radio, Thinking) unless **Show inactive** is ticked. Behind an auth proxy (e.g. Traefik forward auth with Authentik), set `admintrustedproxies` and `adminusers` and signed-in users get in without the token. The page is a Svelte app in
`web/admin`, built into `internal/admin/dist` and embedded in the binary; its JSON API is under `/api/v1`.

## Plugins

-   **`plugins/`** ships with the code. None of the plugins is tied to one deployment; everything site-specific is a setting under `env:`. `plugins/lib/metald_tools` is a shared library they all use, and custom plugins can too: safety review, URL guard, ComfyUI client, chat and vision calls, hosting uploads, media metadata stripping, the lyricist and the image prompt refiner.
-   **`custom-plugins/`** is for your own. Everything in it except its README is git-ignored. In Docker, put them in the `plugins/` folder of the mounted config folder. See `custom-plugins/README.md` for the plugin contract.

Plugins are optional; the bot starts with none. An enabled plugin must have every setting it declares as required, or the bot refuses to start and names the plugin and the setting:

| plugin | requires under `env:` | also reads |
|---|---|---|
| `websearch`, `webfetch` | `EXA_API_KEY` | |
| `sandbox` | `FLY_API_TOKEN`, `SANDBOX_SAFETY_POLICY` | `FLY_SANDBOX_APP`, `FLY_SANDBOX_REGION`, `SANDBOX_IMAGE`, `SANDBOX_C_IMAGE` (the compiler image for `c` and `cpp`, default `gcc:14`) |
| `imagegen` | `IMAGE_SAFETY_PROMPT`, `IMAGE_PROMPT_REFINER`, file hosting (below) | `COMFYUI_URL`, `VISION_API_URL` for the safety check, `IMAGE_GEN_NEGATIVE` (a negative prompt for every image) and `IMAGE_GEN_NEGATIVE_CFG` (guidance when a negative is used, default `2.5`; roughly doubles render time) |
| `musicgen` | `MUSIC_SAFETY_POLICY`, `LYRICIST_PROMPT`, `LYRICIST_FORMAT`, file hosting | `COMFYUI_URL`, `SAFETY_REVIEW_URL` |
| `videogen` | `VIDEO_SAFETY_POLICY`, `VIDEO_NEGATIVE_PROMPT`, file hosting; `ffmpeg` on PATH | `COMFYUI_URL`, `SAFETY_REVIEW_URL` |
| `tts` | file hosting | `COMFYUI_URL`, `TTS_VOICES` |
| `cat_pic` | `CAT_PIC_ROAST_PROMPT` | `VISION_API_URL` |
| `paste` | `GIST_URL`, `GIST_TOKEN`, `PASTE_SAFETY_POLICY` | `SAFETY_REVIEW_URL` |
| `stt`, `vision` | | `WHISPER_URL`; `VISION_API_URL`, `VISION_API_KEY`, `VISION_MAX_SIDE` (default 1536: larger images are shrunk to fit the model) |
| `wikipedia`, `musicinfo`, `youtube`, `datetime`, `weather` | | |

Tools that run a safety review (`musicgen`, `videogen`, `paste`, `sandbox`) also require `SAFETY_REVIEW_PREAMBLE` unless `SAFETY_REVIEW_MODE` is `score`. `examples/chatbot.yml` lists every setting in its `env:` section, with the default text of every prompt and policy.

### File hosting

Images, songs, speech and video go through one uploader, chosen with `UPLOAD_BACKEND`:

-   `zipline` (default): needs `ZIPLINE_URL` and `ZIPLINE_TOKEN`
-   `imgbb`: needs `IMGBB_API_KEY`; images only
-   `http`: any other host, described by settings: the endpoint (`UPLOAD_URL`, which may contain `{filename}`), method, multipart or raw body, extra form fields, where the link is in the response (`UPLOAD_RESPONSE`: a JSON path or `text`), and how expiry is sent

`UPLOAD_HEADERS` adds headers to every upload on every backend, for example `"Authorization: Bearer $FILES_TOKEN"`. For a host the `http` backend can't describe, a custom plugin can call `hosting.register_backend()`.

## Commands

Commands start with the command prefix, `+` by default (`commandprefix: "!"` to change it; punctuation only). By default they must also be addressed to the bot by name, as the first word: `Mizira +stats` or `Mizira: +stats`. A bare `+stats` is left for other bots in the channel, which often share the same prefix (`commandsneedname: false` brings back bare commands). Commands run immediately, even while a long request is in progress. The tables below show the command part only.

| command | admin | |
|---|---|---|
| `+help` | | list commands |
| `+version` | | show the version |
| `+stats` | | show this conversation's size and token use |
| `+reset` | | clear this channel's conversation, custom persona and model switch; the channel recap is kept |
| `+task <what to do>` / `+tasks` | quota for non-admins | start a background task, or list them; `+task result <id>` shows a result, `+task cancel <id>` stops one (its owner or an admin) |
| `+task pause` / `+task resume` | admin | stop starting background work, or carry on |
| `+goal <objective> [done when: <criteria>]` | quota for non-admins | work on something in rounds until a reviewer confirms the criteria are met; `+goal status <id>` shows its round, checklist and last review, `+goal nudge <id> <hint>` steers its next round, `+goal accept <id>` starts a goal the bot proposed, `+goal cancel <id>` stops it |
| `+schedule in <30m\|2h\|1d> <what to do>` | quota for non-admins | run something once, later |
| `+schedule every <2h> <...>` / `+schedule daily <HH:MM> <...>` | admin | run something on repeat (at most every 15 minutes; times are UTC); `+schedule cancel <id>` stops it |
| `+recap` / `+recap clear` / `+recap fold` | admin | post this channel's recap as a paste (inline if no paste tool is loaded), delete it, or fold the older conversation into it now (keeps the last 6 turns) |
| `+suspicion` / `+suspicion <nick>` / `+suspicion clear <nick>` | anyone; clear is admin | show the decaying per-speaker suspicion scores on this network, highest first, or one nick's score; clear one now |
| `+np` | anyone | say what the web radio is playing (reads `RADIO_API_URL` / `RADIO_PAGE_URL`) |
| `+skip` | anyone | skip the web radio's current track; one skip per 20 seconds across everyone (reads `RADIO_API_URL` / `RADIO_TOKEN`) |
| `+prompt <text>` | yes | set a custom persona for this channel; it disables every tool until `+reset`. No argument shows the current state |
| `+memories` / `+memories about <nick>` | | list stored memories |
| `+remember <fact>` / `+remember <nick>: <fact>` | | save a fact about yourself or someone else, through the same safety checks as the bot's memory tool; the reply names the saved id |
| `+recall [nick]` | | what is stored about someone (yourself by default) |
| `+memories clear <nick>` / `+memories forget <id>` | own memories only | clear all memories about a nick, or delete one; admins may do either for anyone. A memory locked on the operator page is kept by every forget from IRC (and by compaction) until it is unlocked there |
| `+tools` | | list loaded tools |
| `+tools load <spec>` / `+tools rm <pattern>` | yes | load or unload a tool |
| `+tools restrict <pattern>` / `+tools unrestrict <pattern>` | yes | make tools admin-only, or lift that |
| `+get <key>` / `+set <key> <value>` | yes | read or change a setting; changing `model` or `prompt` clears this channel's history, other settings keep it. A new `prompt` reaches every conversation not running a `+prompt` persona |
| `+models` / `+models <name>` | yes | list the models an OpenAI-compatible backend (`openaiurl`) serves, or switch to one |
| `+backend` | yes | check that the OpenAI-compatible backend answers |
| `+admins` / `+admins add <hostmask>` / `+admins remove <hostmask>` | yes | manage admins |
| `+ignore <nick> [duration] [reason]` / `+unignore <nick>` | yes | stop answering someone for a while (default 1h) |
| `+ignore` / `+ignore list` | yes | who is ignored, time left, and how: flood, the bot (and whose message it was answering), or an admin, with the reason |
| `+pause` / `+resume` / `+stop` | yes | pause: start nothing new, let running replies finish. stop: cancel everything now. Both persist across restarts until `+resume`; admin commands still work meanwhile |
| `+bots list` / `+bots add nick\|prefix <value>` / `+bots remove nick\|prefix <value>` | yes | manage who counts as another bot |
| `+screen <nick>` / `+unscreen <nick>` / `+screen list` | yes | put a nick behind inbound and outbound screening, dropping their earlier turns |

## Native tools

These run inside the bot and are listed in `tool:` by name:

-   `irc__op`, `irc__kick`, `irc__ban` (ban and unban), `irc__topic`, `irc__invite`, `irc__mode_set`, `irc__mode_query`: channel management, subject to the bot's own channel permissions.
-   `irc__names`, `irc__whois`: who is in the channel.
-   `irc__action`: send a `/me` action.
-   `irc__ignore`: let the bot mute someone itself, for at most an hour. Admins can't be muted.
-   `irc__slap`: the old IRC joke, `/me slaps bob around a bit with a large trout` (or whatever fits). The target must be in the channel; each nick at most once per two minutes. A plain "<bot> slap bob with a noodle" runs it directly.
-   `irc__remind`, `irc__reminders`: schedule, list and cancel reminders.
-   `memory__remember`, `memory__recall`, `memory__forget`: the bot's long-term memory, checked by `memorypolicy` on every write. Forget names a memory by its words, never a guessed id, and asks which one when several match.
-   `history__search`: search what was said in this channel over the last `historydays`, including lines not addressed to the bot. Private messages are never logged.
-   `task__start`: background work. Enabling it also loads:
    -   `task__schedule` (do something once, later) and `goal__propose` (suggest a goal the person accepts with `+goal accept`);
    -   `todo__set`, `todo__update` and `task__note`, which exist only inside background work and keep its checklist and notes, and `task__delegate`, which hands a focused sub-question to a helper with its own short budget and returns the answer to the work (one at a time, so background work never holds more than two model slots; a helper cannot delegate further).

    Background work runs apart from the conversation with its own budget (`taskmaxtime`, `taskmaxiterations`), one round at a time per network, resumes after a restart, and posts its result where it was asked for (long results as a paste). A goal runs in rounds; after each one a reviewer (`goalverifyprompt`) checks what the round actually did against the goal's criteria and either passes it, sends it back with feedback, or stops it. Background work never gets the channel-management tools and cannot start more background work.

## Sandboxing

With `sandbox: true` (or `--sandbox`, or `METALD_SANDBOX`), shell scripts, the built-in `bash` tool, and MCP servers launched from `tool:` run inside a platform sandbox. Off by default.

**Requirements**: `sandbox-exec` on macOS, `bwrap` (bubblewrap) on Linux. If neither is available the setting is ignored with a `sandbox_unavailable` warning and tools run as before.

**Default policy** for every sandboxed tool:

-   Writes allowed only under the OS temp directory.
-   Outbound network blocked.
-   Sensitive paths blocked from reads: `~/.ssh`, `~/.gnupg`, `~/.aws`, `~/.azure`, `~/.config/gcloud`, `~/.kube`, `~/.docker/config.json`, `~/.npmrc`, `~/.config/gh`, `~/.netrc`, `~/.git-credentials`, macOS keychains, and other credential stores.
-   Each sandboxed tool's description gets a `[sandboxed]` suffix so the model knows it's restricted.

**Per-tool overrides**: a plugin declares a `sandbox` field in its `--schema` output; an MCP server's JSON file adds it next to `command`/`args`:

```json
"sandbox": true
"sandbox": { "allowNetwork": true, "writablePaths": ["/tmp/data"] }
"sandbox": { "denyWrite": true }
"sandbox": { "allowEnv": ["HOME", "PATH"] }
```

`false` opts the tool out entirely. Leaving the field out applies the default policy. `POLLYTOOL_*` variables are always stripped from sandboxed processes unless listed in `allowEnv`. Native tools run in-process and are unaffected.

The sandbox lives in pollytool; see [pollytool's Sandboxing section](https://github.com/alexschlessinger/pollytool#sandboxing) and [API.md](https://github.com/alexschlessinger/pollytool/blob/main/API.md) for the full schema and per-platform details.
